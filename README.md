Assignment #2 for the NMD 105 Creative Coding Class. This repository contains 4 javascript files, this assignment tests our knowledge of functions and our creativity.

The first Task is to draw our initial in a 5x5 grid, but this time we must call a function 5 times to do so.
The second task uses the beginShape() and endShape() functions to draw a shape
The third task is to take this shape and implement it into a function while using variables.
The fourth task is to take our initials and make a creative flag out of the countries that start with our initials. For my flag I chose to use Canade and Cape Verde,
I liked using the hsla function and making the canadian leaf, and then using those repeatedly in functons.
